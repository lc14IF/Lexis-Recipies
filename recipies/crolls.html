<h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 cup warm milk (110째F/45째C)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Here is how</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Dough
        <ul>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</ul>
        <ul>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, softened butter, salt, eggs, and the yeast mixture.</ul>
        <ul>Mix until the dough comes together, then knead for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</ul>
        <ul>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</ul>
        </li>
    <li>Make the Filling
        <ul>In a small bowl, mix the softened butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon until well combined.</ul>
        </li>
    <li>Assemble the Rolls
        <ul>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface into a rectangle, approximately 16x12 inches.</ul>
        <ul>Spread the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the dough.</ul>
        <ul>Roll up the dough tightly, starting from the long edge, and pinch the seam to seal.</ul>
        <ul>Cut the rolled dough into 12 equal slices and place them in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish.</ul>
        <ul>Cover the dish with a clean cloth and let the rolls rise again for about 30 minutes, until doubled in size.</ul>
        </li>
    <li>Bake the Rolls
        <ul>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).</ul>
        <ul>Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.</ul>
        </li>
    <li>Prepare the Icing
        <ul>Once the cinnamon rolls are baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.</ul>
        <ul>Spread the icing generously over the warm rolls.</ul>
    </li>  
</ol>
